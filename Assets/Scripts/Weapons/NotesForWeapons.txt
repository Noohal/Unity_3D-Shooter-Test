# Instructions for Creating a New Weapon

## Find Weapon Model
First, find a proper model for the desired weapon and adjust the transform (position,
rotation, scale). 

### Adjust Arm Viewmodel to Fit Weapon
Self-explanatory: Change the rotation of the arms so that the arms are holding the
gun.

## Rearrange GameObject Hierarchy
Make sure that the arms are a child of the weapon model.
In other words:
     Gun_Model_Object
     |-----> Arms
             |-----> etc

NOTE: Make sure that after reparenting and such, the transform of the weapon still
fits with the viewmodel

## Create a Prefab for the Gun
Self-explanatory.

## Create Weapon Script for Weapon
Use other weapon classes as a template and make a script and fill out all the fields.
